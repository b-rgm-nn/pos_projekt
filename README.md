In order to run the program:

create an empty database for this purpose and record the name
fill in your login details in db_login.txt
    username = <your username>
    pw = <your password>
    dbname = <the name of the database you just created>
When the program is first started it will ask for confirmation to parse
the data from a csv into the database. This process will take around 3 Minutes.
The program is now ready for use. There should already be some sample queries
that can be loaded, otherwise they are commented at the top of the GUI file
